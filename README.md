# Lectures

Build with XeLaTeX (build scripts are included, they're pretty straightforward).

If notes include code listings, <a href="https://github.com/gpoore/minted">minted</a> is required.
More precisely, it's probably already shipped with your favorite LaTeX distribution, 
but require some additional software to be installed: Python and Pygments (see minted's README).
Please note that minted >= 2.0 is required, you probably should install it manually in your local texmf directory.

You will also need additional fonts:
* Computer Modern Unicode: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cm-unicode/files/cm-unicode/0.7.0/cm-unicode-0.7.0-ttf.tar.xz/download
* Latin Modern Math: http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/lm-math/download/latinmodern-math-1959.zip
